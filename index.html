        What have we done so far?
      </p>

      <p>
        So far in this final project, our group has created slides and outlined where our data visualizations
        will go. Along with this, we added some css styling and animations. In our slides we introduced what CO2
        ice cores are and an interactive chart showcasing atmospheric CO₂ levels and gas age. With scrolly-telling, 
        we are able to zoom in and out of the chart to show specific sections, letting viewers see both the 
        large-scale patterns and the detailed fluctuations.
      </p>

      <p>
        What will be the most challenging part to design?
      </p>

      <p>
        The most challenging part of this project design would be making multiple interactive graphs 
        without the feeling of endless scrolling for viewers. Making sure that each visual feels meaningful 
        and that transitions between them feel smooth instead of overwhelming. In addition to this, making 
        sure the interactive graphs are functional and not lagging down the website or breaking. 
        Another challenge would be balancing aesthetics and readability, making sure that the animations 
        support our story rather than distract from it. Another challenging aspect would be
        making the charts understandable to viewers without any background in ice core research.
